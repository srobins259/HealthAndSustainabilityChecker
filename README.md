System Description
-----
The GHData Visualizer is a front-end tool made to give an interface to the GHData project, the GHData project is a project that provides data related to GitHub repositories.

Our tool allows the user to input a repository name and the owner name for the repository, and graphs are developed for metrics made by the GHData project.  These metrics show the "health" of a repository, these are called OSS Health Indicators.  OSS Health Indicators are metrics about the health and sustainability of open source projects.  All metrics are value free, but a user may derive value from the metrics displayed on the GHData Visualizer project.

With seeing the metrics in the form of graphs, the user may also label the metrics for a visual representation on the metric being a "Good" metric, "Neutral" metric, or a "Bad" metric. This is done by a form being created with displaying the choices for these options and making the graphs visually represented with a colorized background.

Below are visual examples on how our tool works:

DFD Description of GHData Visualizer
---------------------------------------
As shown in the diagram below, the user will submit a repo address to the tool, which will format it in a way that will pass well to GHData.

Using GHData, it will obtain the repository statistics and pass the data to a DJango controller. The controller will format the data in a way that can populate the graphs and push it to the view.

The user will then be able to see the statistics formatted into graphs, tables, and the ratings systems.

CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT
---------------------

We are in the very early stages of development so we are not enrolling any new collaborators at this point.

Development Environment
------------
- This software is developed on Mac(need macOS Sierra v. 10.12.3), Asus(need Windows 10), and P.C.(need Windows 10) environments using the Atom text Editor(need version 1.15.0)
- Python 3.4.X
- MySQL 5.X or later version
- [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html) in database


Our tool will utilize the  [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html) database. This is the current database that GHData uses, and the schema can be viewed below:

INSTALLATION
----------
With a server solution
1. Clone the ropository into your server solution's web serving.
2. Follow the OSSHealth/ghdata setup process to prepare ghdata.
3. Start your server if you have not already.
4. Go to the repository directory in your terminal and enter "ghdata" to start the process
5. In your browser, access the repository in its location on your server
6. Access the frontend by accessing http://(yourServerIP)/(RepositoryLocation)/frontend
7. Type a repository name and owner into the corresponding fields in the form.
8. Use the good, neutral, and bad buttons to highlight the corresponding metric graphs.


System Description
-----
The GHData Visualizer is a front-end tool made to give an interface to the GHData project, the GHData project is a project that provides data related to GitHub repositories.

Our tool allows the user to input a repository name and the owner name for the repository, and graphs are developed for metrics made by the GHData project.  These metrics show the "health" of a repository, these are called OSS Health Indicators.  OSS Health Indicators are metrics about the health and sustainability of open source projects.  All metrics are value free, but a user may derive value from the metrics displayed on the GHData Visualizer project.

With seeing the metrics in the form of graphs, the user may also label the metrics for a visual representation on the metric being a "Good" metric, "Neutral" metric, or a "Bad" metric. This is done by a form being created with displaying the choices for these options and making the graphs visually represented with a colorized background.

Below are visual examples on how our tool works:

DFD Description of GHData Visualizer
---------------------------------------
As shown in the diagram below, the user will submit a repo address to the tool, which will format it in a way that will pass well to GHData.

Using GHData, it will obtain the repository statistics and pass the data to a DJango controller. The controller will format the data in a way that can populate the graphs and push it to the view.

The user will then be able to see the statistics formatted into graphs, tables, and the ratings systems.
